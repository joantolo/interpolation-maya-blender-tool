# Interpolate and orient tool for Maya and Blender

<p> Here you can see the first tools I developed for Maya and Blender. </p>

First, I developed the tool for Blender, and after a time I have ported it to Maya.

Given a series of position keyframes, you can interpolate them using linear, Hermite or Catmull-Rom interpolation methods.
Also, you can control the velocity of the animation using a parametrization method.

On the other side, you can orient the object following the trajectory of the animation or just interpolate the rotation by quaternions.
