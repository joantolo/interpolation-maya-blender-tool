# Interpolate and orient using a Blender tool

<p> Here you can see the first tool I developed for Blender. </p>

Given a series of keyframes, you can interpolate them using linear, Hermite or Catmull-Rom interpolation methods.
Also, you can control the velocity of the animation using a parametrization method.

On the other side, you can orient the object following the trajectory of the animation or just interpolate the rotation by quaternions.
